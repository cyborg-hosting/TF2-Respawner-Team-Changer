## IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not my own plugin, but other's. But i couldn't reach plugin's owner so publish this on github with credit.

## NOTE:  
 This is my first plugin ever! I didn't really have any idea what to make until i needed something like this on my server. I'm sure there is already a plugin that does this and maybe there's not but this plugin was really just made for me to learn/practice pawn, so give me errors or advice please!! And also no rude comments í¸‰ Like i said im new tot his.  
  
## Description:  
 Simply just allows Admins with ROOT access to the server to change any players team or respawn someone who is dead or you just want to mess with them and move them to the beginning via chat or Cvars.  
  
## Commands:  
!respawn or /respawn: to respawn any player who is dead or alive. \[Usage: !respawn <name>\]  
!move or /move: used to move a player to a given team. \[Usage: !move <name> <0/1/2/3> "_1 = Spectators, 2 = red, 3 = Blue_"  
  
## Installation:  
Put sm\_rsptc.smx into /addons/sourcemod/plugins and reboot your server or type "sm plugins load sm\_rsptc" into your console or rcon.
